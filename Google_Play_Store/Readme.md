Various methods of the Pandas library ghas been used to replace data

The Data Preprocesig feature had also been used to Normalise the data.

Finally an output is provided comparing the original test Result with comparison between two predicted value
i.e. one with feature normalization

#Next time I'll also try to plot graphical results and Calculate Error as well as score for Differernt Algorithms.
